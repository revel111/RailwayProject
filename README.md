# RailwayProject
Simulation of railway infrastructure on Java.
The main goal is OOP, dealing with files and multithreading. There are many classes representing locomotives, railroad cars, trainsets, rails and stations so at the start of the application we have generated trainsets
and stations with connections between them. We can create own stations, rails, trainsets etc. and then launch trainset. In console we can observe movement of trainsets launched by user.
